Clarifai JavaScript
===========================

We are using the Clarifai API to classify the image selected by the player and provides this image as an input to the Clarifai API. Once the image is classified we receive a set of tags associated to that image. We then check if our required image name exists in those tags and produce a result YES or NO accordingly.
